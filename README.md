- **Introduction**
	Spotify Playlist shuffler is a web app that shuffles a Spotify playlist and makes a new Spotify playlist with the exciting same song in it 

- **Design**
	
	- First, the user is authenticated by Spotify
	- After that with the help of spotify API we show the list of playlist that user have 
	- User select a playlist and we get all the songs of that playlist and shuffle that and create a new playlist useing Spotify API

- **Application**
	This site can be used by music lovers to shuffle their Spotify playlist 
	
- **Future vision/Scope**
	 The problem with this version is we have to give access to the user in the Spotify developer dashboard then only the user can use this site. We want to solve this so that any user can use this site in future without we have to give manually access to them
