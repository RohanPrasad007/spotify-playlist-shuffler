- **Introduction**
	Spotify Playlist shuffler is a web app that shuffles a Spotify playlist and makes a new Spotify playlist with the exciting same song in it.

- **Design**
	
	- First, the user is authenticated by Spotify.
	- After that, with the help of spotify API, we list the playlist that the user has.
	- User selects a playlist and all songs of the playlist are shuffled and a new playlist is created using the Spotify API.

- **Application**
	This site can be used by music lovers to shuffle their Spotify playlist 
	
- **Future vision/Scope**
	 The problem with this version is to give access to the user in Spotify developer dashboard, only then can the user use this site. We may want to solve this so that any user can use this site without giving manually access to them.
